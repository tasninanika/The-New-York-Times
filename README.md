# The New York Times - React News Application

This is a dynamic, real-time news application inspired by **The New York Times**, built with modern web technologies. The app allows users to view and read the latest news, breaking stories, and access individual news details fetched from an API. Users need to **log in securely** to view specific news details. The app supports **Email/Password**, **Google**, and **GitHub** login methods via **Firebase Authentication**. The news section displays the most current headlines, updated dynamically with **Moment.js**.

## Installation

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/the-new-york-times.git
cd the-new-york-times
```

### Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Start the development server:

npm start
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

## Firebase Setup

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or use an existing one.
3. Enable Firebase Authentication with **Email/Password**, **Google**, and **GitHub** sign-in methods.
4. Set up the **Firebase configuration** in the projectâ€™s `firebase.config.js` file.
5. Deploy the app using Firebase Hosting once everything is set up.

## Secure Login Process

- **Login Required for News Details:** To ensure the privacy and security of news content, users must log in to access detailed articles. This ensures that only authenticated users can interact with the full content of the news. Firebase Authentication provides a highly secure way of logging in via **Email/Password**, **Google**, or **GitHub**.
  
- **Authentication Security:** Firebase Authentication uses secure token-based authentication, ensuring user credentials and data are encrypted during login. Additionally, the **OAuth** sign-in methods (Google and GitHub) leverage industry-standard security practices, ensuring a smooth and secure user experience.

## How It Works

- **Authentication:** Users can sign up and log in using their email and password, or they can use **Google** or **GitHub** to authenticate themselves via Firebase.
- **News Feed:** The app fetches news articles from an external API and displays them in a card-style layout.
- **Marquee & Breaking News:** The marquee displays breaking news headlines that change dynamically.
- **Individual News Page:** Users must log in to view detailed news articles. Clicking on a news headline redirects users to the detailed page, but login is required to see the full content.
